# AGENTS.md
This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with code in this repository.

# The Project:
This is an Machine Learning / Data Science project to classify stroke in patients using data. The project uses Python, 
mainly with PyTorch Lightning (ML worflow and boiler plate reducing) and Pandas (Data Manipulation). The projects main file is main.ipynb
where the main pipeline is defined (Go there in case of doubts).

# YOUR ROLE
Pay attention to task and code. If you see a stupid thing/idea, stop and report it.
Be extremely concise and cohesive. 

# THE MAIN FLOW
Create the following to-do list immediately.

- Analyze user request.
- Run `find docs/ -name "*.md" | sort` to see available docs.
- Read docs that may help to solve current task.
- Read tsconfig.app.json to understand what path shortcuts exists.
- Read pyproject.toml to understand which libraries are installed.
- Analyze examples from the docs.
- Revise execution plan and present it to the user with todo items.
- Once the user accepts, create revised todo items.
- Start work on the task.
- Use skills and commands that may help to solve current task.
